Ragdoll tools is an addon for generating ragdolls in Blender.

All its functions are collected in one pie menu

|pie_menu|

It can be found in the search popup

|search|


Hitboxes
========

To start with, take some model which is attached to armature

|model|

Select model and its armature and run **Generate hitboxes** operator from the pie menu

The result should look like this

|hitboxes|

You can adjust shape of the hitboxes via the operator settings

|shapes|

If you wish,you can also generate hitboxes from the bones using same operator.

|from_bones|

Also you can take any mesh object and connect it to any bone as hitbox.

|monkey|

To do this,select object, then go to the **Pose Mode** ,select bone ,and run **Connect** operator from the pie menu.

So,no matter which method you choose,now you have a bunch of hitboxes connected to the bones.

|hitboxes_final|

What mean that connection?
==========================
Every bone follows its hitbox if they are connected...or hitbox follows the bone.It depends on the **Follow bone** property of each hitbox.

This property can be found in the physics tab.

|follow_bone|

You can change it for all selected objects at once if you hold the ``Alt`` during change (this works for almost any property in Blender)

To animate some property on selected objects use this `addon <https://github.com/xbodya13/keyframe_selected>`_

Constraints
===========
If you run the simulation right now,everything just falls apart.

To make a ragdoll you need to connect all these hitboxes with constraints.

To do this ,select all hitboxes and call **Generate rigid body constraints** operator from the pie menu

|constraints|


For good result you may need to adjust physical properties of the hitboxes and constraints.

These operators can be helpful to set that properties for all selected objects at once.

|pie_menu_setters|

To see constraint limits in viewport ,install this `addon <https://github.com/xbodya13/visual_limits>`_

When you're done with constraints,it's time to run simulation


Bake
====

Once you're satisfied with the animation of the ragdoll,it's time to bake it to the bones.

You can do it using **Bake** operator.

|bake|

It also can be used to copy animation from bones to hitboxes.Just make hitboxes follow bones and chose **Hitboxes animation bake** in operator settings.

Disconnect
==========
If you no longer need hitboxes, select them or their bones and run **Disconnect** operator

|clear|


Videos
======
Check out these videos to see it all in action.

They were made in Blender 2.79 but the workflow is the same for Blender 2.8x
